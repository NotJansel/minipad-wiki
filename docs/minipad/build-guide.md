Building the minipad is very straight forward. The case is designed in a way **10mm long self-tapping flat-head M3** screws can be inserted into the sockets. The scews tap (hence the need to be *self-tapping*) into the resin, holding the two parts of the case together with the PCB in place in-between.

It is important to use **self-tapping** screws (pointy nose), as other screws will not be able to "dig" into the case material. **M3** means the screw has a diameter of 3mm, which is important for the screw to fit. It is also important to choose **10mm** long, **flat-headed** screws since otherwise they will be sticking out of the case on the bottom.

Here's are step-by-step instructions on how to build the minipad together:
1. **Put the PCB into the top side of the case.** Make sure the components on the PCB are facing you and *not* the case.
2. **Put the bottom part of the case on top of the case.** The hole for the USB port should align with the top part.
3. **Put 4x 10mm self-tapping flat-head M3 screws into the sockets.** Screw them all the way in, until the screws no longer stick out.
4. **Put the switches into the holes on top of the case.** The side of the switch that looks special is meant to point upwards.
5. **Put the keycaps onto the switches**, then you're done!
