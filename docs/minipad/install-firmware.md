This guide will teach you how to download and flash the firmware for the minipad step by step. Before proceeding, please make sure that the minipad is plugged into your computer. These steps can be used both for the initial setup of your minipad, as well as for updating the firmware.
If you do not use minitility, please manually make sure to check for firmware updates frequently as they are important for fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities.
